It could simply be a natural Area drop in Maelstrom of Chaos. Its weight is so low that it's possible it simply hasn't been observed before.\n\nIf this were somehow a misleading generic drop, assuming solely natural weights, the probability of a coincidence is ~0.0000364.\n(And Zimzams did not observed any other unexpected Cards from explodey Mysterious Barrels, so the real chance is even less.)\n\nDivcord: 3.20, Jasmine found a drop in Maelstrom of Chaos from a non-Barrel source, though the Map did have explodey Mysterious Barrels. The Barrels themselves (or monsters within it) did not appear to drop any unusual cards, debunking the theory of random div cards other than possible reward conversion.\nSeems like it's simply a natural Area drop in Maelstrom of Chaos. (The Card art looks like a maelstrom.)\n\nTo confirm, a positive result will be required from one of:\na) Maelstrom of Chaos, without Barrel sextant\nb) Any non-Maelstrom map, with (explody) Barrel sextant"
