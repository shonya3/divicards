If {Chateau, Conservatory} also have The Porcupine as an eligible natural Card, and no other Maps do, maybe that's the answer...?\n\nDisproved in Chateau with 367 natural card drops; not simply labyrinth_tileset_area.\nDivcord: 3.21, Zimzams tested Conservatory; 71 natural Card drops, 0 hits.\n\nMonster-specific hypotheses are not common, so looking more at area tags, \"garden_area OR (labyrinth_tileset_area & NOT indoors_area)\" does fit the bill and includes Plaza on top of the garden_area maps.
