We'd need a new verification of a drop from Gorulis in 3.18.\nGorulis (1) is based on a Monster on the Story Pantheon; (2) is in a god_boss_map_area Area; (3) is *not* in PantheonSouls.dat; (4) *cannot* be captured in 3.18, though was capturable in the past.\n\nExamples that would support Option 2 are:\nCaptain Clayborne, The Accursed; Puruna, The Challenger; Captain Tanner Lightfoot; Sebbert, Crescent's Point; Shock and Horror; Forest of Flames; Vision of Justice; The Infernal King; Pagan Bishop of Agony; The Cursed King; Lycius, Midnight's Howl; The Hallowed Husk; The Restless Shade\nA drop from any of these Bosses would show that having a capturable soul enables the drop even without Story Pantheon presence.\n\nIt's also possible for both Option 1 and Option 2 to be true simultaneously.\n\n3.19: See More is Never Enough, above.

We'd need a new verification of a drop from Gorulis in 3.18.\nGorulis (1) is based on a Monster on the Story Pantheon; (2) is in a god_boss_map_area Area; (3) is *not* in PantheonSouls.dat; (4) *cannot* be captured in 3.18, though was capturable in the past.\n\nExamples that would support Option 2 are:\nCaptain Clayborne, The Accursed; Puruna, The Challenger; Captain Tanner Lightfoot; Sebbert, Crescent's Point; Shock and Horror; Forest of Flames; Vision of Justice; The Infernal King; Pagan Bishop of Agony; The Cursed King; Lycius, Midnight's Howl; The Hallowed Husk; The Restless Shade\nA drop from any of these Bosses would show that having a capturable soul enables the drop even without Story Pantheon presence.\n\nIt's also possible for both Option 1 and Option 2 to be true simultaneously.\n\n3.19: Jasmine verified a drop from Khor, Sister of Shadows in Cold River who is NOT capturable (though Ara, Sister of Light is). This proves that \"capturability\" is not a requirement.\n\n3.19: Observed in an Atlas Memory Cemetery Map, not from Boss -- could Atlas Memories behave differently? - confirmed."

We don't know if they're still true.\n* If the Hydra claim were about an Area drop, I'd assume it to be another example of a drop from a Jeweller's Strongbox that someone mistakenly misattributed as an Area drop.\n* If the claim were instead about a Boss-specific drop, I don't know what to expect re: data for that. If it's eligible, it's likely very uncommon.\n\nHere's a \"Hydra\" claim from 2019 relayed by sirgog (https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/cuynv7/check_out_one_of_the_new_divination_cards_from/ey1knly/); but 2019 is far before the modern Card location rework, so even if it was true in the past it might not be true anymore.\n\n(Wiki also has old claims of Basilica, Terrace from 2018. Terrace was tested in Divcord during ~Aug 2022, n=1941 natural Card drops with no hits of The Celestial Stone -- but given the rarity of the Card, that test was technically inconclusive. So far, no affirmative modern evidence exists of drops in those Areas.)\n3.21: Total cards 2146.\n\nDeterministic drop from Jeweller's Strongboxes"

It could simply be a natural Area drop in Maelstrom of Chaos. Its weight is so low that it's possible it simply hasn't been observed before.\n\nIf this were somehow a misleading generic drop, assuming solely natural weights, the probability of a coincidence is ~0.0000364.\n(And Zimzams did not observed any other unexpected Cards from explodey Mysterious Barrels, so the real chance is even less.)\n\nDivcord: 3.20, Jasmine found a drop in Maelstrom of Chaos from a non-Barrel source, though the Map did have explodey Mysterious Barrels. The Barrels themselves (or monsters within it) did not appear to drop any unusual cards, debunking the theory of random div cards other than possible reward conversion.\nSeems like it's simply a natural Area drop in Maelstrom of Chaos.

Maybe toxic_pool_area + fire_affinity? Does not explain The Boiling Lake, however.\n\nDivcord: Zimzams tested Bog and Marshes in 3.19, disproved The Eye of the Dragon with >99.9% confidence. This means `fetid_area`, `toxic_pool_area` alone are insufficient.\n\nI wonder if it has to do with the Basilisk-type Boss, given the observation of it dropping in Story The Boiling Lake?\n\nPerhaps a rule like: \"Natural Area drop in an Area with a Basilisk-type Map Boss\", or perhaps a reference to at least two of the Map Boss's Tags like `fire_affinity`+`reptile_beast`?\n\nOr perhaps even another name/internal reference check like that of The Spoiled Prince? I noticed that the internal name of the Sulphur Vents Map Boss (The Gorgon) is `IguanaBossPhoenixMap` which strangely includes the word \"Phoenix\", and The Eye of the Dragon was also found in Forge of the Phoenix (which we thought was possibly just a hardcoded exception like some other Shaper Guardian Area Cards).\nThe only relevant Monsters with internal name like /phoenix/ are Guardian of the Phoenix, The Basilisk, and The Gorgon -- so there currently are not any others to test."

The only verified drop location is Doryani's Machinarium."

If {Chateau, Conservatory} also have The Porcupine as an eligible natural Card, and no other Maps do, maybe that's the answer...?\n\nDisproved in Chateau with 367 natural card drops; not simply labyrinth_tileset_area.\nDivcord: 3.21, Zimzams tested Conservatory; 71 natural Card drops, 0 hits.\n\nMonster-specific hypotheses are not common, so looking more at area tags, \"garden_area OR (labyrinth_tileset_area & NOT indoors_area)\" does fit the bill and includes Plaza on top of the garden_area maps.

Thus that Tag cannot be the governing factor.\n\nRe-verified as dropping in Silo in 3.18 using a legacy-series Silo Map on Standard.\nBut other Maps that have Silo's Tags do not seem to produce The Tireless Extractor.\n\nThere's something else special about Factory and Silo which govern the natural Card drop in those Areas. Forge_Area in 3.21 connected the two maps, but the actual relationship could be something else.\n\n3.21: Elinvynia found no cards in 56 cards in Foundry or 20 in Phoenix.

If eligible, in the long run, observing 1 The Leviathan would require ~1000 runs of T16 Maelstrom of Chaos (assuming 68% Area IIQ, no Sextants, and 0 Player IIQ).\nObviously that could be greatly improved by using an MF character and picking good Sextants and pushing Area IIQ. But the general playerbase doesn't do those things. Most players probably run Maelstrom of Chaos at most once per league, likely as soon as they can at a low Tier for early Atlas completion (e.g. T4 this league), and The Leviathan has a Drop Level Requirement of 81 so it's not eligible in low-Tier versions anyway.\n\nIf it does indeed drop elsewhere, it will likely correspond to ocean_area, or less likely, map_area_with_open_water.\nReverified in 3.21 from Maelstrom of Chaos."
